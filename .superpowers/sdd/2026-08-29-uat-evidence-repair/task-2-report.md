# Task 2 report: Explorer critical coverage boundary tests

Date: 2026-08-29

Branch: `codex/profile-settings-tabs-rebase-20260828`

Scope: test-only code changes to `explorers-earth/src/features/music/__tests__/publicMusicClient.test.ts`, plus this evidence report

## Outcome

The Explorer critical coverage lane now passes at 100% statements, branches, functions, and lines, both per file and in aggregate. The repair adds behavioral boundary tests; it does not change `publicMusicClient.ts` or any other production file, and it performs no live service calls or writes.

## Initial RED and authoritative V8 audit

Command:

```text
npm run test:music-critical-coverage
```

Result: exit 1. All 16 test files and all 369 tests passed, but the coverage threshold failed.

| Scope | Statements | Branches | Functions | Lines |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Aggregate | 96.99% (871/898) | 95.65% (770/805) | 100% (192/192) | 99.31% (726/731) |
| `publicMusicClient.ts` | 86.08% | 79.16% | 100% | 96.59% |

The text reporter listed uncovered lines `55, 99, 165-166, 243`. A second run with the same V8 lane plus `--coverage.reporter=json` established the exact uncovered locations from `coverage-final.json`.

The first focused run of the resource batch had one expected fixture-design failure: the nominally empty protected queue fixture still exposed `currentlyPlaying` while both queue and playback permissions were false. The production parser correctly rejected it. The fixture was narrowed by setting `currentlyPlaying` to `null`, after which the batch passed. This did not reveal or authorize a production change.

## Behavioral matrices added

- Playlist envelope total/truncation inconsistencies, invalid history status/timestamp states, and canonical empty protected queue/history/playlist envelopes.
- Request endpoint HTTP mapping for 400, 403, 404, 409, 413, 429, and 503; valid and invalid request IDs; retry values capped at 300 seconds or defaulted safely for negative/non-finite inputs.
- Oversized, invalid-UTF8, malformed-JSON, and missing request bodies, with exact safe `size`, `encoding`, or `json` observability reasons.
- Search, video URL, request-song, slug, idempotency, canonical-song, and strict response-schema guards, all asserting public error codes and pre-network rejection where applicable.
- Descriptor input, status, retry, request-ID, JSON, and schema guards.
- Signal and no-signal request construction, plus configured and packaged-default module base URLs.
- Operational events are asserted through the real observability adapter and checked to exclude hostile response data, capability-shaped values, authority tokens, and service-base values.

Each matrix asserts consumer-visible behavior or the public boundary contract. No test was added solely to call a line, and network doubles are confined to the external `fetch` boundary.

## Final verification

| Command | Result |
|---|---|
| `npx vitest run src/features/music/__tests__/publicMusicClient.test.ts` | PASS: 1 file, 102 tests |
| `npm run test:music-critical-coverage` | PASS: 16 files, 414 tests; aggregate 898/898 statements, 805/805 branches, 192/192 functions, 731/731 lines |
| `npm run test:unit` | PASS: 190 files, 1,961 tests |
| `npm run lint` | PASS (exit 0): 0 errors, 1,377 existing warnings |
| `npx eslint src/features/music/__tests__/publicMusicClient.test.ts` | PASS: no findings |
| `npm run build` | PASS: landing checks, static generation, TypeScript, Vite, and HTTPS-only Music transport check |
| `git diff --check` | PASS |

The full unit run emits existing jsdom diagnostics for unimplemented canvas/scroll methods and the intentional `AppErrorBoundary` throw case. The production build emits existing bundle-size, CommonJS, and ineffective-dynamic-import warnings. None caused a failure or originated in the modified test.

Build verification regenerated sitemap dates. The generated `public/sitemap.xml` diff was inspected and restored, leaving no build artifact or production-file change in the task diff.

## Production changes and concerns

- Production code changes: none.
- Live services or writes: none; all transport behavior uses stubbed `fetch` responses.
- Product defects found: none. The only failed new assertion was the isolated fixture-design issue documented above.
- Residual concern: repository-wide lint/build/unit diagnostics remain noisy but are pre-existing and non-blocking; the modified test file is lint-clean.

## Independent review

Per the SDD controller, an independent reviewer will be dispatched against the committed Task 2 diff. The final disposition belongs to that post-commit review and is not pre-claimed here.
