/**
 * Why this file exists.
 *
 * Retiring Strapi means deleting `gql` documents, and 51 of 60 in the surviving Apollo
 * modules were deleted once measured unreachable. The nine that remain are **not**
 * unreachable, and the reasons are invisible to every tool you would reach for first:
 *
 * - Five are named only by Playwright specs under `e2e/` — one of them through a dynamic
 *   `await import('/src/features/.../query.ts')`, which no import graph resolves.
 * - Four are required by *source scanners* that read the module as text and match on the
 *   GraphQL **operation name**, insisting on exactly one document per operation.
 *
 * Neither kind is visible to `tsc`, and the e2e lanes that would catch the first kind run
 * only on pull requests targeting `main` (`ci.yml` is
 * `pull_request: branches: [main, develop]`, and the qualification workflow is
 * schedule-only). So on a feature branch, deleting one of these is silent.
 *
 * I did exactly that during the retirement and caught it by accident: three documents were
 * reported as "named only in a ticket" because the analysis stopped at the first match and
 * markdown sorted ahead of `e2e/`. This test turns that accident into a gate, on the unit
 * lane, which `test.yml` runs for every pull request against any base.
 *
 * **If a pair below is genuinely retired, delete the consumer and the entry together.**
 * The point is to make it a decision instead of a surprise.
