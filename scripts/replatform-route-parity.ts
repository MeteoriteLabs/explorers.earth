/**
 * Fixture ingress parity for ticket 1.2's route-graph invariant.
 *
 * The invariant requires the platform fixture runtime to mount the same canonical
 * application route graph as the replacement production runtime, "as their owning
 * epics land". Until 2026-10-08 this inventory probed only six legacy/Strapi/
 * analytics paths and the test pinned the count to exactly six, so the invariant
 * passed **vacuously** with respect to every canonical surface: a missing
 * canonical route could not fail it.
 *
 * Every expectation below is measured against the real canonical app
 * (`createCanonicalApp`), not read off a handler. `platform-route-signatures.test.ts`
 * holds that measurement as a standing contract, so these expectations cannot
 * silently drift from what the application actually answers. None of the probed
 * paths touches the database, which is what lets that test run without a container.
 *
 * Rules for extending this file, from the 1.2 correction:
 *   - append, never weaken or delete an existing probe;
 *   - never lower the expected count to accommodate an absent route — a canonical
 *     route promised by a landed epic and missing from the fixture graph is a
 *     failure, not a skip;
 *   - this is a shared file. Every epic landing a canonical route appends here
 *     under coordinator allocation rather than forking a second parity script.
