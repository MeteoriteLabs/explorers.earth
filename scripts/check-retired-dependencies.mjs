/**
 * Ticket 8.1a's static scan: a ratchet on the canonical server's Strapi coupling.
 *
 * It does NOT assert that Strapi is retired — it is not, and the legacy-music
 * server still speaks to it by design until step 12 deletes that path. What it
 * asserts is the property 8.1a's exit gate depends on, measured over the static
 * import closure of the canonical entrypoint:
 *
 *   1. no Strapi client is constructed anywhere in the canonical closure;
 *   2. no module in the canonical closure reads a STRAPI_* variable, except the
 *      few sites allowlisted below with a reason and a disposition;
 *   3. no Strapi-named module enters the canonical closure beyond the one
 *      allowlisted below.
 *
 * Each allowlist entry is a known, measured site — not a waiver. Adding a new
 * one is a decision someone has to write down here, which is the point: the
 * failure mode this guards against is coupling creeping back in one import at a
 * time while every suite stays green.
 *
 * Full classification and the evidence behind each allowlist entry:
 * docs/replatform-audit/strapi-server-classification.md
 *
 * Usage: node scripts/check-retired-dependencies.mjs [--json]
 * Exit 0 when every invariant holds, 1 on a violation, 2 on a scan error.

 * therefore never stripped, and this function's own contract did not hold: a STRAPI_*
 * mention inside a line comment in the canonical closure failed the scan as though it
 * were a real read.
 *
 * Demonstrated by probe rather than argued: a line comment naming process.env.STRAPI_URL
 * added to a closure module passes with this normalisation and reports a violation
 * without it.
 *
 * That direction is over-strict rather than unsafe, so no violation was missed by it. It
