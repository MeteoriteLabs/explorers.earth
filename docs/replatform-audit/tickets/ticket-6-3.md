## 2026-10-05 execution amendment

Read the [re-groomed dependency and ownership plan](../../superpowers/plans/2026-10-05-replatform-regroomed-execution.md), including this ticket's all-ticket disposition, before allocation. Preserve the implementation and acceptance requirements below. Canonical producer, active consumer, fixture, real-backend evidence and exact-commit hosted status must be tracked separately; missing future producers are dependencies, never fixture waivers. Every new delegated assignment uses a fresh agent. Proposed original paths/commands must be checked against current source before execution.

## Current execution card

**Disposition:** waiting. **Technical inputs:** 6.1, 6.2. Dependencies refer to reviewed interfaces for partial packages; complete-ticket acceptance retains all original gates.

**Next package:** Qualify guest capability, public playback, replay/revocation and socket separation after canonical owner behavior.

**Ownership:** The ticket owns its category/feature files listed below. Shared schema, migration identifiers, route registration, auth clients, Settings, seeds and protected manifests require coordinator allocation before any writer starts. Do not dispatch overlapping writers.

**Execution gate:** Verify listed paths and actual package scripts against current source; classify proposed tests as to-create, never executed. Record the exact failing behavior before changing production code; run focused automated regressions, canonical real-backend/browser acceptance, fresh independent review, then commit/push and exact-SHA hosted checks. Preserve source/dependency hashes, counts/skips, first failure and owned-resource cleanup. Historical acceptance is retained, not rerun by default. External inputs and deployment authority remain explicit gates.

**Current commands:** Read the [command custody correction](../command-custody-2026-10-05.md). Historical generic suite/project/environment commands are proposed interfaces, not supported current runner flags; original behavior obligations remain required.

## Required context

Read the [authoritative database schema](../target-database-schema.md) and apply the [shared execution checklist](../execution-checklist.md) to affected surfaces. Apply the parent epic's global constraints, shared interface definitions, review focus and test-harness prerequisites. Those contracts are maintained once in the epic, rather than copied into thirty-eight potentially conflicting versions. Existing files refer to the pinned audit source; paths labelled create/new were proposed when authored. Commands and checkboxes specify required verification, not completed runs.

## Implementation and acceptance

**Depends on:** 6.2. **Modify:** `tunes/server/socket/musicSocketServer.ts`, `tunes/server/repositories/musicPublicationOperationRepository.ts`, `tunes/server/services/musicPublicChangeListener.ts`, `tunes/server/policies/musicSurfacePolicy.ts`; `explorers-earth/src/features/music/publicMusicClient.ts`, `publicMusicLiveClient.ts`, `ownerMusicLiveClient.ts`, `musicPublishCoordinator.ts`; existing `tunes/server/test/music-public-socket.test.ts`, `music-publication-operation.integration.test.ts`, `music-public-revision-contract.test.ts`; create `explorers-earth/e2e/replatform/music-public.spec.ts`.

- [ ] Add/update failing tests for public vs unlisted capability vs revoked sharing, repeated publication key, mismatched replay body, hidden queue controls, guest request limits, denied origin, expired authority and out-of-order revision notifications.
- [ ] Preserve hashed guest capability, durable encrypted replay and retired-key semantics; update account lookups to canonical mapping and keep guest transport separate from owner authentication.
- [ ] Run two browser contexts (owner and guest), guest request/owner acceptance, player-state update, connection drop/reconnect, revocation while connected and suspension. Verify hidden data never appears through socket payloads or direct public endpoint fetches.
- [ ] Run PostgreSQL publication integration, socket/security tests and real-stack browser spec plus existing Music public qualification command with its documented environment. Commit. **Done:** full owner/public/guest music coverage is ready for Milestone 2; no deferred UI rebuild is needed.

## Independent review verification (2026-10-05)

NOT-STARTED, and correctly **blocked behind 6.2** (and transitively 6.1). The `:13` disposition "waiting" stands. Measured reasons, against source at `225d83e5`:

- The socket is still keyed on the general 600-second HTTP bearer, not a purpose-limited handshake. `explorers-earth/src/hooks/useTunesDashboard.ts:107-109` passes the HTTP credential token into the owner subscription; `tunes/server/socket/musicSocketServer.ts:272,278` consumes it as the handshake value; `tunes/server/services/musicTokenService.ts:127-128` pins that token's lifetime to exactly 600 seconds. The `:32` obligation "keep guest transport separate from owner authentication" cannot be verified while owner socket and owner HTTP share one credential.

**Re-measured 2026-10-06, after 6.1 landed.** 6.1 did **not** deliver this, so it needs an owner here rather than an upstream reference. The call path is confirmed: `musicSocketServer.ts:278` calls `ownerCredentials.handshake({ token })`, which is `createMusicSocketCredentialVerifier` at `server/middleware/musicPrincipal.ts:167-169`, and that calls `principals.resolve(token)` — byte-for-byte the resolver every owner HTTP request uses. There is no purpose claim, no distinct audience and no shorter lifetime, so a leaked socket ticket is a ten-minute owner HTTP bearer.

Four things measured for whoever implements it:

- **Minting a purpose-limited ticket changes nothing on its own.** The gain only exists once the socket *stops* accepting a general bearer, which means the verification has to be asymmetric: HTTP must reject a token carrying a purpose claim, and the socket must require one. Shipping the mint without flipping the socket repeats 6.1's shape — provisioning delivered without the release — and should be treated as incomplete, not as progress.
- **`MusicTokenClaims` already has an optional-claim channel.** `CLAIM_KEYS` holds the seven required claims and `OPTIONAL_CLAIM_KEYS` currently holds only `subjectKind`, added by 6.1, so a `purpose` claim fits the strict decoder without widening the required set.
- **The 600-second lifetime is pinned by an explicit invariant** — `musicTokenService.ts` throws unless `tokenLifetimeSeconds` is exactly 600. A 60-second socket ticket needs its own constant rather than a configuration change, so that invariant stays intact.
- **Reconnection interacts with a short lifetime.** `ownerMusicLiveClient.ts:33-41` sets `reconnection: true` with `reconnectionDelayMax: 30_000`, and the auth object is captured once at `:43`. A 60-second ticket therefore expires across a backoff, so the client has to obtain a fresh ticket per connection attempt rather than reuse one. This is the part the `:33` reconnect obligation actually exercises.

`musicTokenService.ts` is under a 100%-per-file coverage threshold in `test:music-critical-coverage`, so every new branch needs its own test in the same package.
- Owner clients still ride the legacy bearer (`explorers-earth/src/lib/localTunesApiClient.ts:194`), so the `:32` obligation to "update account lookups to canonical mapping" has no canonical mapping to update against: `tunes/server/repositories/musicDomainRepository.ts:1196,1209` still key on `strapi_account_document_id`.
- 6.1 is undispatchable until [ADR-005](../../adr/005-music-identity-migration-deployment-authority.md) `:16-20` is superseded — see [ADR-006](../../adr/006-canonical-music-identity-supersedes-strapi-proof.md) (Proposed). That preflight transitively gates this ticket.

Note for 7.1: `ticket-7-1.md:13` lists 6.3 among its technical inputs, but the shared canonical navigation slice runs with no Music producer. That is a phantom dependency for the shared slice only; full 7.1 parity does consume Music public/unlisted/revoked semantics from this ticket.

### Step 2 correction (2026-10-07)

The handshake-ticket route landed in `99e8da96` with two defects that CI caught and one it could not.

CI caught the contract artifacts. The Music surface keeps three generated-or-hand-maintained records of its routes, and adding one route obliges all three: the hand-written OpenAPI 3.1 document in `server/routes/musicOpenApiRoutes.ts`, whose contract test demands *exact* parity with the live canonical route list; `docs/architecture/music-runtime-surface-inventory.json`, regenerated by `tunes/scripts/inventory-runtime-surfaces.ts --write`; and `docs/architecture/music-authorization-matrix.json`, regenerated by `tunes/scripts/generate-music-authorization-matrix.ts` **from that inventory file**, so the two must be regenerated in that order or the matrix is rebuilt from a stale inventory. The inventory also records each route's source line, so editing the OpenAPI document shifts `/api-docs` and makes the inventory stale by itself — the regeneration is not optional even when no route changed.

CI could not catch the real defect. The route was mounted with the `owner(...)` chain, which is `identify + principal + ownerInputGuard`; `mutation(...)` is `owner(originGuard, ...)`. Every other owner-mutating Music route uses `mutation`, so the ticket route was the only POST that would mint a live socket capability for a signed-in owner on request from **any** origin — a CSRF-shaped hole whose blast radius is a socket capability rather than a single write. It passed every suite because the route had no route-level test at all; only the OpenAPI contract's "a non-GET owner operation must declare an exact Origin" rule made the omission visible, and then only indirectly.

Both are fixed, and `music-surface-routes.test.ts` now covers the route: minting for a proven owner behind an allowed origin, refusal of a foreign origin and of a missing origin, refusal of an unauthenticated caller, and a 404 when no minter is wired so an optional dependency is not advertised as a capability. Reverting `mutation` to `owner` turns the origin case from 403 to 200, so the guard is pinned rather than incidental.

### Step 3 delivered (2026-10-07): the socket accepts only a handshake ticket

The switchover the re-measurement above called the actual gain. The socket no longer accepts a general Music credential, and the client mints a ticket per connection attempt.

**The design problem was the recheck, not the handshake.** `createMusicSocketCredentialVerifier` retained the handshake token and `recheck()` re-ran `principals.resolve(token)` on it, which re-verifies expiry. A 60-second ticket would therefore have disconnected every owner a minute after connecting. The resolution splits token verification from identity resolution: `MusicPrincipalService.resolveSubject(subject)` runs every identity-side check — tombstone, suspension, pending deletion, session-version bump, and canonical-versus-legacy branch — against a `MusicPrincipalSubject` rather than a token, and `resolve()` and `resolveSocketTicket()` are the two verifying front doors onto it. Nothing is weakened by not re-checking expiry: revocation is an identity fact, and all of it still fails on a recheck exactly as it does on an HTTP request.

**One property did need rescuing.** `music-principal.test.ts` asserted that an already-connected socket is evicted once the key that signed its credential leaves its bounded acceptance window — the operator's emergency credential invalidation. Resolving the subject without the token would have silently dropped it. So `MusicTokenService` gained `verifyContext`/`verifySocketTicketContext`, which return the verified claims *and* the key ID that vouched for them, plus `acceptsSigningKey(kid)`; the subject carries `signingKeyId` and `resolveSubject` refuses a retired key. Rotation still evicts live sockets, and the connection holds a key ID rather than a replayable credential — strictly less than the token it used to retain.

**Client.** `subscribeToOwnerMusic` takes `mintTicket()` instead of a captured `token`, and passes Socket.IO the callback form of `auth`, which it invokes on every connection attempt including reconnects. On a mint failure it presents no credential rather than the previous ticket, so the server refuses and Socket.IO retries under its own backoff. `useTunesDashboard` now gates the subscription on whether a credential *exists* rather than on its value, so a routine ten-minute credential rotation no longer tears down and rebuilds the live connection — a side benefit of decoupling the two credentials.

**Evidence.** 19 principal cases, 225 across the tunes security and socket lanes, 857 frontend unit tests, 1180 contract cases, both typechecks clean, and `musicTokenService.ts` and `musicPrincipal.ts` both at 100% statements/branches/functions/lines under the per-file gate. New cases pin each claim: the handshake refuses a general credential; a canonical subject kind survives the handshake and its rechecks; an expired ticket keeps an open connection alive but cannot open a second one; and a reconnect mints a fresh ticket and never falls back to the previous one.

Remaining for this ticket: the reconnect case in a real browser lane, which is 6.2's `:33` obligation and now unblocked.

### Step 3 proven against a real socket (2026-10-07)

The asymmetry step 2 described is now exercised end to end by `server/test/music-socket-handshake.integration.test.ts`, over real PostgreSQL and a real Socket.IO server: the socket admits only a ticket minted through the real HTTP route, refuses the general credential, and refuses the ticket when it is presented back as an owner bearer while the credential still reads the dashboard. Reverting the verifier to accept a general credential fails all three cases, so the separation is pinned rather than incidental.

That test also closed the defect this ticket nearly shipped. `mintSocketTicket` was an optional dependency and `routes/index.ts` never passed it, so the mint route did not mount while the socket already required a ticket — every owner would have failed to connect. The dependency is required now and the route mounts unconditionally; the compiler refuses a composition that omits it. Note the gate that catches this is `npm run music:types:scoped`, not the repository-wide `tsc --noEmit`, which does not cover the contract test files.

### Guest and revocation coverage added to the same real-stack test (2026-10-07)

`:31`-`:34` are broader than the handshake, so they were measured rather than assumed. Most of the ticket was already covered by suites it lists under **Modify**: `music-public-socket.test.ts` (5 cases), `music-publication-operation.integration.test.ts` (12), and browser-level owner-and-guest behaviour in `e2e/music-publish-controls.spec.ts` (69) and `e2e/music-public-contract.spec.ts` (13). Repeated publication keys, mismatched replay bodies, revoked sharing, suspension and out-of-order revision notifications all have existing cases — the last as "advances one public snapshot revision per committed visible mutation and never for no-op, replay, stale, conflict, or lifecycle replay" and "rejects a delayed older playback revision after the newer owner intent is canonical" in the domain integration suite.

Two clauses had no real-stack proof, and both are now in `music-socket-handshake.integration.test.ts`:

- **`:32` guest transport separate from owner authentication.** A guest is admitted by capability alone, never a credential; the server stores only the hash; revoking it denies a fresh connection while the owner's path still admits. Writing this surfaced migration 0002's invariant that changing `guest_capability_hash` requires `guest_capability_rotated_at` — a hash cannot be swapped silently. The test satisfies that rather than working around it, which is the rotation semantics this clause asks to preserve.
- **`:33` revocation while connected.** `MusicLifecycleService` revokes through `MusicOwnerSocketRegistry`, so the test connects a live owner socket, revokes through that registry and asserts the socket actually drops. This is the epic's `:54` obligation that a suspended owner loses socket authority and not only HTTP access, which no HTTP-only test can show.

**Not claimed.** `:33`'s "two browser contexts" is covered in browser form by the fixture lanes above and at real-stack level by the socket cases here, not by a single two-context real-stack browser lane. `e2e/replatform/music-public.spec.ts` and `music-public-revision-contract.test.ts` are named in this ticket and remain absent; their behaviour is covered under other names, listed above. The reason a single lane was not built is the two-origin topology recorded in [ticket 6.2](ticket-6-2.md).
