# Ticket 1.3: CI and deployment separation

**Status:** consult the [durable implementation ledger](../../../.superpowers/sdd/epic-01/progress.md); checkboxes below do not assert implementation status.

[Parent epic and shared contracts](../epics/epic-01.md) · [Master plan](../implementation-plan.md) · [All tickets](../ticket-index.md) · [Shared execution checklist](../execution-checklist.md)

## 2026-10-05 execution amendment

Read the [re-groomed dependency and ownership plan](../../superpowers/plans/2026-10-05-replatform-regroomed-execution.md), including this ticket's all-ticket disposition, before allocation. Preserve the implementation and acceptance requirements below. Canonical producer, active consumer, fixture, real-backend evidence and exact-commit hosted status must be tracked separately; missing future producers are dependencies, never fixture waivers. Every new delegated assignment uses a fresh agent. Proposed original paths/commands must be checked against current source before execution.

## Current execution card

**Disposition:** complete. **Technical inputs:** 1.2. Dependencies refer to reviewed interfaces for partial packages; complete-ticket acceptance retains all original gates.

**Next package:** Preserve required hosted checks and immutable promotion contract.

**Ownership:** The ticket owns its category/feature files listed below. Shared schema, migration identifiers, route registration, auth clients, Settings, seeds and protected manifests require coordinator allocation before any writer starts. Do not dispatch overlapping writers.

**Execution gate:** Verify listed paths and actual package scripts against current source; classify proposed tests as to-create, never executed. Record the exact failing behavior before changing production code; run focused automated regressions, canonical real-backend/browser acceptance, fresh independent review, then commit/push and exact-SHA hosted checks. Preserve source/dependency hashes, counts/skips, first failure and owned-resource cleanup. Historical acceptance is retained, not rerun by default. External inputs and deployment authority remain explicit gates.

**Current commands:** Read the [command custody correction](../command-custody-2026-10-05.md). Historical generic suite/project/environment commands are proposed interfaces, not supported current runner flags; original behavior obligations remain required.

## Required context

Read the [authoritative database schema](../target-database-schema.md) and apply the [shared execution checklist](../execution-checklist.md) to affected surfaces. Apply the parent epic's global constraints, shared interface definitions, review focus and test-harness prerequisites. Those contracts are maintained once in the epic, rather than copied into thirty-eight potentially conflicting versions. Existing files refer to the pinned audit source; paths labelled create/new were proposed when authored. Commands and checkboxes specify required verification, not completed runs.

## Implementation and acceptance

**Prerequisite:** 1.1 baseline; 1.2 safe test orchestration. Must complete before first implementation push.

**Files:** modify `.github/workflows/{ci,test,music-c0-contracts,tunes,explorers,tunes-deploy,frontend-e2e-qualification}.yml` where triggered scopes change; inspect `music-reconcile.yml`, `tunes-host-preflight.yml`, `tunes-test-direct-deploy.yml`; create `tunes/server/test/contracts/replatform-workflow-authority.test.ts` and `docs/replatform/ci-check-map.md`. Preserve required job names until settings are deliberately reconciled.

**Interface produced:** validation runs for PRs targeting main, including draft PRs, with root/backend/frontend/workflow/fixture/shared paths included. Deploy authority is explicit environment plus digest plus matching recorded source revision. No PR receives SSH/deployment privileges. Suggested branch is `codex/unified-replatform`; branch creation is implementation work, not this planning step.

**Verified configuration gap:** read-only GitHub metadata found no required main status checks and no dedicated QA environment. After observing a real PR run, define an aggregate `replatform-required` check that rejects failed/missing/unexpectedly skipped required jobs; configure the repository rule to require that exact check through authorized repository settings. Record administrator bypass policy. Do not claim CI enforcement from workflow files alone. Create a QA environment restricted to the integration branch with environment-scoped credentials as part of implementation, not this review.

- [ ] Record all relevant workflow triggers, path filters, checkout ref choices, secrets scopes, job dependencies and deploy calls. Check `workflow_run` trust and head revision handling, dispatch main guards, scheduled production jobs and production environment protections.
- [ ] Add a workflow contract test matrix: feature push and PR cannot invoke deployment; main CI completion cannot deploy the new stack without release authority; dispatch on non-main cannot deploy production; failed/skipped validation cannot satisfy release; path changes in shared contracts or workflows run relevant checks.
- [ ] Run `npm test --prefix tunes -- --run server/test/contracts/replatform-workflow-authority.test.ts` and observe expected failures. Implement explicit conditions and minimum permissions; do not remove unrelated production protection. The expired temporary deploy is not used for QA.
- [ ] Wire bounded local-equivalent checks: lint/type/build, unit/domain, real PG integration/security, named E2E smoke suites. Retain deeper browser/load/chaos lanes as milestone/manual or nightly checks with explicit triggers and evidence.
- [ ] Run changed workflow contract tests and existing `server/test/contracts` suite. Validate workflow syntax with available GitHub/actionlint tooling; do not install tools solely to claim validation when unavailable.
- [ ] Push the integration branch created in 1.1 and create its draft PR only after static trigger review. Inspect real run conclusions and exact source revision. Resolve baseline failures openly; no green-by-skip claim. Record required-check settings separately from source.
- [ ] Commit workflow/check-map changes. **Gate:** feature branch has executed validation, no deployment job was invoked, and required checks resolve. CI syntax tests alone do not establish remote CI success.
