# Analytics and public Music UAT evidence — 2026-08-29

## Verdict and evidence rule

**Not release qualified.** No retained evidence proves that the guarded owner/guest run executed all 17 mutation journeys, observed the required analytics deliveries, and restored every journey. No Task 3 command used the fixture stack or performed a live write.

This revision distinguishes a retained artifact from a contemporaneous report. `Proven` below means the cited bytes are still available and hashable. `Reported-but-not-retained` means a prior report states the result but the stdout, stderr, per-test report, or inspection output needed to reproduce it is absent. `Observed-not-proven` means the operator/reviewer observed a stage, but the retained artifact does not encode that stage. An unavailable field is written as unavailable rather than reconstructed.

The original qualification base was `25cc0ee296ca48ca59e14267bebcb8faf73efea9`; `origin/main` was reported as `9284a5dbc606979bb3607a7f5934f8b61519ebdc`. Current evidence-repair commits independently reviewed before this task are `e1e28a68630cfc065c091146ce14d4dd905e2505` (live evidence safety) and `8e16a08c9167228bc0b9f77ff2c75c9a7ea68065` (Explorer boundary coverage).

## Guarded-attempt chronology

There were at least two distinct guarded attempts. Neither is the sole attempt, and their evidence must not be combined.

| Attempt | Order and commit | Command / cwd | Exit and totals | What is retained | Qualification |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A — earlier Playwright execution | Earlier than attempt B. Exact commit SHA unavailable. | Exact command and working directory unavailable. | Reported: runner nonzero; Playwright 48 total = 31 passed, 0 failed, 17 skipped. Exact runner exit code and skip reasons unavailable. | No immutable stdout/stderr, per-test report, skip ledger, analytics ledger, visual/trace, Docker inspection, or per-journey restoration hashes retained. | **Reported-but-not-retained.** It does not prove any mutation journey ran or restored. |
| B — later reviewed preflight stop | Reported at `e32ad351c9dd4ba4c6c66f041649289ab705b388`. | Exact invoked command and working directory unavailable. The documented entry point was `npm run music:test:public-e2e`, but the retained artifact does not prove that invocation. | Exact exit code and Playwright totals unavailable; contemporaneous review says nonzero and stopped in preflight. | Local `explorers-earth/.artifacts/music-public/20260829041053317/evidence.json`, 756 bytes, SHA-256 `737cff10fbd4717cbd54c2126e818d9a1e4c5062306656654863fe0f1c9ae120`. | **Failed.** Preflight-stop/before-callback is observed-not-proven by the artifact. Equal final hashes are proven by its current bytes. |

Attempt B's retained JSON proves only `result=failed`, `cleanup=restored`, and one equal before/after pair:

```text
328835bdc95100d75ff52a873bfd697b5a03b1d2da1f9d5b842eeca75ec4efdd
```

It does not contain a stage field, terminal journey records, an analytics ledger, a skip ledger, stdout/stderr, a Docker command/output record, or a manifest. Therefore the claims “preflight stopped before callback,” “zero labeled containers/volumes,” and “the cleanup command succeeded” remain observed-not-proven or reported-but-not-retained. A current directory audit finds only `evidence.json`, so the two private auth files are absent now; that current observation is not substitute proof of the historical deletion commands.

## Historical lane register

The following register covers every lane named by the original UAT document. Unless a retained path is listed, no immutable stdout/stderr artifact exists.

| Lane | Commit, exact command and cwd | Exit / totals | Retained evidence and gap |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

## Current non-live repair evidence

These lanes are not live UAT. Their committed reports are retained, but terminal stdout/stderr were not separately preserved under the new manifest format, so they do not retroactively satisfy that format.

| Lane | Exact SHA, command and cwd | Exit / totals | Retained report |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Task 1 final focused | `e1e28a68630cfc065c091146ce14d4dd905e2505`; `npx playwright test e2e/music-harness-contract.spec.ts --project=chromium-pr-safe`; cwd `explorers-earth`. | Exit 0; 53 total = 53 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped. | `.superpowers/sdd/2026-08-29-uat-evidence-repair/task-1-report.md`, 24,327 bytes, SHA-256 `311cff47570af239a988e09209136eef2e120168c078d0ea39b41c1ced5b199d`. |
| Task 1 sanitized broad | Same SHA; the exact environment-clearing prefix was not retained, followed by the `chromium-pr-safe` Playwright lane; cwd `explorers-earth`. | Exit 0; 197 total = 180 passed, 0 failed, 17 skipped. Skip reason: the reviewed live mutation cases were intentionally gated. | Same Task 1 report; stdout/stderr unavailable. |
| Task 2 critical coverage | `8e16a08c9167228bc0b9f77ff2c75c9a7ea68065`; `npm run test:music-critical-coverage`; cwd `explorers-earth`. | Exit 0; 16 files, 418 passed, 0 failed; 100% statements/branches/functions/lines. | `.superpowers/sdd/2026-08-29-uat-evidence-repair/task-2-report.md`, 9,828 bytes, SHA-256 `cee46b5d6acf98e9dfb51534a83462e65c77989dd5dee9c1c6c81b41f21366cb`. |
| Task 2 unit | Same SHA; `npm run test:unit`; cwd `explorers-earth`. | Exit 0; 190 files, 1,965 passed, 0 failed. | Same Task 2 report; stdout/stderr unavailable. |

## Visual, trace, and analytics truth

Neither guarded attempt retained a live-attempt screenshot, video, or trace. “No live visual/trace retained” is the exact evidence state; the earlier broad statement that failed-run traces lived under `test-results` did not identify immutable attempt paths and is withdrawn.

Six tracked deterministic regression baselines exist, but they are not live-attempt evidence:

| Relative path | Bytes | SHA-256 |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `explorers-earth/e2e/music-public-contract.spec.ts-snapshots/320-long-nav-stress.png` | 22,758 | `afcf2e9cb843d72ddce34fbd87526ce29aeecb839a7c034653d7a4f5e584bdaa` |

No guarded attempt retained an observed analytics-event ledger. Read-only tests cover safe event fields, UTM propagation, retry, and exactly-once behavior, but those tests are not an observation of a guarded live delivery. Live analytics therefore remains an explicit evidence gap.

For a future observed record, `analytics-events.jsonl` accepts only product-event enums, `utm_source|utm_medium|utm_campaign|utm_term|utm_content` with bounded non-secret values, SHA-256 occurrence and event identifiers, bounded attempt/duplicate counts, `distinctEventIds=1`, `committedEvents=1`, and `exactlyOnce=true`. A stopped or unobserved run stores one typed `unavailable` record with zero events; it never creates placeholder events.

## Mandatory post-reset bootstrap gate

The next authorized attempt must preserve this order: exact fixture-only `music:db:reset`; read-only proof of zero volumes carrying both reviewed fixture/project labels; read-only proof that ports `55432`, `51337`, `55000`, `55173`, and `55174` have no listeners; successful `npm run --silent music:fixture:authority:attest`; then `npm run music:test:public-e2e`. The live runner repeats the exact attestation immediately before bootstrap. It sets `fixtureLifecycleAttempted` only after acceptance, so a rejected gate is pre-bootstrap and performs no `down`; this classification is valid only after the separate volume and port proofs.

The child attestation is a single canonical JSON line with only `schemaVersion`, `state`, `safeToBootstrap`, and `usableRecords`. Only `absent|tombstone`, `true`, and `0` are accepted. Reference/live, raw/nonempty, populated, malformed, unsupported, ambiguous, unreadable, symlinked, credential-bearing, extra-field, multi-record, nonzero-exit, signal, and spawn-error states all block. Raw stdout/stderr is discarded rather than sanitized into evidence. `db:reset` uses the same oracle after retiring only authenticated fixture authority; deletion of database volumes without the absent/zero authority postcondition cannot return success.

## Executable evidence contract for the next run

From repository-relative cwd `explorers-earth`, each runner invocation allocates one new direct child of its fixed `.artifacts/music-public` parent with exclusive-create semantics. The runner accepts no parent from CLI or environment; the allocator rejects reuse, traversal, symlinks, or a parent outside an exact `.artifacts/music-public` hierarchy. The parent may be created separately; the run child is never recursively reopened.

Every complete run contains these required relative paths:

```text
logs/fixture-bootstrap.stdout.log
logs/fixture-bootstrap.stderr.log
logs/fixture-up.stdout.log
logs/fixture-up.stderr.log
logs/fixture-down.stdout.log
logs/fixture-down.stderr.log
logs/state-service.stdout.log
logs/state-service.stderr.log
fixture-authority.json
analytics-events.jsonl
visual-trace-ledger.json
docker-inspection.json
skip-reasons.json
restoration.json
evidence.json
manifest.json
manifest.sha256
```

Any retained `visuals/*.(png|jpg|jpeg|webp)` or `traces/*.zip` named by `visual-trace-ledger.json` becomes an additional required manifest entry. If none exists, the ledger says `none-retained` with empty arrays.

`manifest.json` is canonical JSON and lists every required artifact except itself and the sidecar as an exact `{role,path,bytes,sha256}` entry. `manifest.sha256` is the self-reference terminus: exactly one lowercase 64-hex SHA-256 plus newline, with no path or other data. The verifier rejects a missing file, an unlisted file/directory, an extra/duplicate/reordered role or path, unsafe path, sidecar mismatch, non-canonical manifest, byte mismatch, or artifact hash mismatch.

The eight per-source stdout/stderr files are the authoritative stream evidence. Each file is independently bounded, path-normalized, and secret-redacted; no lossy aggregate log is used to claim completeness. `fixture-authority.json` retains the exact fixed logical argv, normalized repository cwd, exit code, termination class, and either the strict accepted attestation or `null`; it never retains raw child output. `evidence.json` carries one exact typed record for every declared source/stream with its status, raw observed byte count, retained byte count, and truncation state. The verifier rejects a missing, extra, reordered, duplicated, or metadata-mismatched stream record, and rejects an unsafe fixture-authority state even when an attacker rebuilds every artifact hash and the sidecar. Raw Playwright JSON, output directories, auth files, bearer values, capability values, absolute workspace paths, and unbounded child output are private inputs and must be deleted before manifest creation.

Live fixture `bootstrap`, `up --detach --wait`, and exact `down` never inherit child streams. Each command captures bounded private stdout/stderr, writes the two corresponding independently bounded sanitized stream artifacts, and adds a typed lifecycle record with its fixed logical argv, normalized cwd, exit status, termination class, observed and retained byte counts, and truncation or unavailable state. The loopback state service installs `error`, `exit`, and `close` listeners immediately after spawn and captures its two streams the same way. Spawn error and unexpected terminal-event races route through one idempotent failure finalizer. Shutdown is successful only after an attested terminal `close`: code 0 without a signal, or code `null` with the expected `SIGKILL`; signal acceptance alone is insufficient. A bounded condition/event wait records timeout, nonzero, inconsistent, or unknown termination as cleanup failure while later exact down, Docker inspection, and artifact finalization still run. Raw child output is never sent directly to the invoking terminal.

Once live bootstrap is attempted, every exit path attempts the exact fixture `down` independently of private artifact deletion and state-service shutdown. Each private file/directory removal continues after another removal fails. A live exit is forced to code 5 unless cleanup is both classified `restored` or `not-required-safe` and the exact Docker/auth inspection below verifies no labeled containers, labeled volumes, or private auth artifacts. A down failure, unavailable Docker inspection, residue, private-artifact presence, or any other unverified cleanup classification remains explicit evidence and cannot preserve an ordinary execution exit.

The next guarded run also records these exact cleanup inspections, executed from the repository root, with argv, exit code, and bounded matching output stored in `docker-inspection.json`:

```text
docker ps -aq --filter label=com.explorers.music.fixture=true --filter label=com.explorers.music.project=explorers-music-fixture
docker volume ls -q --filter label=com.explorers.music.fixture=true --filter label=com.explorers.music.project=explorers-music-fixture
```

It separately records whether `owner-auth.json` and `profile-storage-state.json` are absent. Missing Docker output is `unavailable`; it is not replaced with an empty successful inspection.
A live lane is forced to exit 5 when either inspection is unavailable, labeled resources remain, either private auth artifact is not proven absent, exact teardown fails, or restoration is otherwise unverified; the exact gap stays in `evidence.json`.

Independent verification command after a runner finishes:

```text
node scripts/music-public-qualification-artifacts.mjs verify .artifacts/music-public/<runId>
```

## Reviewer index and release blockers

| Requirement | Evidence | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Guarded live chronology | Separate attempts A and B above | Reconciled; neither attempt qualifies UAT |
| Terminal mutation evidence | 17 ordered journey hashes plus final restore required | Missing |
| Analytics/UTM exactly once | Observed safe ledger required | Missing for live UAT |
| Visual/trace inventory | Live ledger required | Historical attempts retained none |
| Immutable streams and manifest | New executable contract | Non-live contract verification required before any live attempt; no historical bundle |
| Docker/auth cleanup | Exact argv/exits/matches required | Historical output not retained |
| Explorer critical coverage | Task 2 committed report | Pass, 418/418 and 100% coverage |
| Live harness safety | Task 1 committed report | Non-live contracts pass; live path deliberately unexercised after repair |
| Repository/database lane | Explicit disposable database authority | Still refused / missing |
| Independent evidence review | Separate reviewer before live execution | Required; not replaced by this author review |

Release remains blocked on independent review of the artifact contract, one newly authorized guarded run that crosses preflight and retains all 17 terminal journey hashes plus an observed analytics ledger, a clean manifest verification, and the explicitly authorized repository/database lane. Push, PR review request, merge, deployment, and production mutation remain outside this evidence repair.
