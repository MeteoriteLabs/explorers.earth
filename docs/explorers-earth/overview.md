# explorers-earth — Overview

## Purpose

explorers-earth is a location recommendation and QR code sharing platform. Users create curated lists of favorite places, add photos and details, generate QR codes, and share their recommendations socially. It's designed for travelers, local businesses, content creators, and anyone wanting to share their favorite spots.

## Architecture

Frontend-only React SPA with no backend code. All data lives in an external Strapi CMS accessed via GraphQL (Apollo Client). Authentication uses JWT tokens from Strapi.

```
Browser
  └── React SPA (Vite 6.4)
        ├── Apollo Client ─── GraphQL ─── Strapi CMS
        ├── Axios ─────────── REST ────── Strapi (uploads)
        ├── Google Maps API ─────────── Google Cloud
        └── localTunesService ────────── tunes API
```

## Feature Modules

The app is organized into self-contained feature modules under `src/features/`:

### Authentication (`features/Authentication/`)
Login, registration, password reset, and Google OAuth integration. Includes an onboarding flow for new users to set up their profile. JWT tokens stored in localStorage.

### Profile (`features/Profile/`)
User profile management with customizable photos, bio, contact info, and social media links. Profiles can be public-facing for sharing recommendations.

### Favorites (`features/Favorites/`)
Core feature — add, edit, and organize favorite places. Each place includes location data, photos, ratings, notes, and categories. Places are organized into themed lists (by city, category, etc.).

### Guides (`features/Guides/`)
AI-powered guide generation. Uses AI services to create curated location guides based on user preferences, place data, and themes.

### Analytics (`features/Analytics/`)
Usage tracking dashboards showing recommendation views, QR scans, and user engagement metrics. Built with React GA4 integration.

### Settings (`features/Settings/`)
User account settings, preferences, notification configuration, and account management.

### LandingPage (`features/LandingPage/`)
Marketing/home page for unauthenticated visitors. Showcases the platform's features and value proposition.

### PublicHome (`features/PublicHome/`)
Public-facing pages that display a user's shared recommendations. Accessible via QR codes and shareable links without authentication.

### Music Dashboard (Embedded tunes Integration)
A major embedded component (`src/components/MusicDashboard.tsx`) that brings the tunes music platform into explorers-earth:
- Multi-tab interface: Queue, Guest Controls, Recently Played, Playlists
- Embedded YouTube mini-player with drag-and-drop queue reordering
- Playlist management (create, edit, delete, import from YouTube/Spotify)
- Song search via YouTube
- Guest control features for venue scenarios
- Data fetching via `useTunesDashboard` hook which syncs the Strapi user with the tunes Neon DB
- Background SSO via `AuthSyncManager` component (fires once per session, skips public pages and onboarding)

## Frontend Architecture

### Routing
React Router DOM 7.12 with:
- Protected routes via `ProtectedRoute` component (checks JWT validity)
- Public routes for shared content (no auth required)
- Layout wrappers in `src/layouts/`

### Components
- `src/components/` — Shared components (Header, Navbar, InteractiveMap, ImageCropper, MusicDashboard, AuthSyncManager)
- `src/components/ui/` — Radix UI primitive wrappers
- Feature-specific components live within their feature module

### Styling
- Tailwind CSS 3.4 for utility-first styling
- Framer Motion for animations and page transitions
- Responsive mobile-first design

### Internationalization
- react-i18next for multi-language support
- Translation files in `src/i18n/`

## Key Patterns

- **Feature modules** are self-contained — components, hooks, and logic live together
- **Image handling**: Multi-source system (user uploads, Google Places photos, custom search) with cropping via react-easy-crop and compression
- **QR codes**: Dynamic generation with qrcode.react, exportable as PNG via html2canvas
- **Maps**: Google Maps with custom markers, clustering, place search, and geocoding
- **Forms**: Formik + Yup for validation
