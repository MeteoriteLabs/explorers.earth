# Music Identity Product Decisions

Status: Accepted
Date: 2026-08-13
Amended: 2026-08-21 (Task 9 durable publication-command authority)
Scope: Explorers embedded Music identity, ownership, and entitlement

## Decision

Explorers is the only consumer identity and onboarding system. Music must not ask an embedded Explorer to register, choose a Music password, or connect a second account.

### Provisioning trigger

After the identity provider or local-email verification is authoritative and the user has completed Explorers onboarding with one unambiguous completed Account, Explorers starts a bodyless, idempotent Music ensure operation.

Provisioning runs automatically in the background. A Music outage does not undo onboarding, block unrelated Explorer routes, or create a second-account recovery flow. The Music page exposes a contextual retry state if automatic provisioning remains incomplete.

### Ownership unit

Music content is owned by the person for this release. Tunes retains its numeric user ID as the owner key for playlists, queue, history, settings, guest capability, and other current domain rows.

The projection also persists the immutable selected Strapi Account document ID. That Account ID is context and a future workspace-migration seam; it is not a mutable authorization input, is not selected by browser array order, and cannot silently switch.

If shared workspace or multi-venue ownership becomes a product requirement, it requires a new ADR and an explicit domain migration rather than reinterpreting existing person-owned rows.

### Entitlement

Every eligible Explorer receives core personal Music capability. Identity projection does not automatically grant venue, administrative, commercial, expanded-quota, or other premium capabilities.

Those capabilities are derived and enforced server-side from the authoritative entitlement policy. The existing persisted state contract is exactly `unknown | included | eligible | entitled | revoked`:

| State | Current authoritative meaning |
|---|---|
| `unknown` | No current authoritative premium-policy decision is available. Core Music remains included; premium mutation is denied. |
| `included` | Core personal Music is included. No premium mutation authority is granted. |
| `eligible` | The user is eligible for a separate trial or premium decision, but is not authorized for premium mutation by this value alone. It is not an upgrade-required UI instruction. |
| `entitled` | Premium mutation is authorized only while `entitlement_source_updated_at` is present, not future-dated, and no more than 600 seconds old. Core Music remains included when that timestamp is stale or absent. |
| `revoked` | Premium mutation authority has been removed. Core Music remains included. This is not identity suspension, a whole-Music pause, a quota state, or read-only core access. |

The Task 9 page may show a nonblocking checking status for `unknown`; the other four values do not create a whole-page entitlement message. Quota/reset/limit and core read-only UX require new authoritative fields in a future versioned API contract and, if persistence changes, a separately reviewed migration. They are not inferred from the five existing values.

### Publication command idempotency

Changing publication mode is one owner-derived server transaction. The client key
has the exact form `tunes-share-v1-<13-digit issued-at epoch milliseconds>-<UUIDv4>`.
The immutable numeric Music owner and a domain-separated SHA-256 hash of that key
identify an append-only operation; the exact requested mode is bound by a
separate request fingerprint. The owner advisory lock and the database primary key
serialize multiple application instances. A matching retry within exactly 24 hours
returns the byte-equivalent logical response without rotating publication authority;
the same key with a different request fails with a conflict and makes no change.
The browser keeps that pending command only in process memory, scoped to the
immutable Explorer user and selected Account plus requested mode/fingerprint. It
survives dialog closure, remount, mode toggles, and ambiguous or malformed
responses, and is cleared only after a strictly validated terminal success or an
exact identity-scope reset.

For unlisted mode the server generates a random 256-bit capability. The canonical
guest authority remains only its hash on the owner row. The response needed for a
lost-response replay is encrypted in the same transaction with AES-256-GCM; its AAD
binds the response schema version, owner, operation hash, request fingerprint, and
key ID. Plaintext capabilities and raw idempotency keys are never persisted. After
24 hours the response is unavailable and the encrypted fields are shredded. The
live tombstone is compacted into an immutable archive, and archive rows older than
30 days are purged in bounded batches. Permanent retirement does not depend on
unbounded tombstone storage: after checking bounded live/archive history but before
any owner mutation, the repository uses PostgreSQL's clock to reject a history-free
issued-at timestamp older than 30 days. Existing history remains authoritative for
the full 24-hour replay window, and the route admits the one-day cutoff overlap. A
key more than five minutes in the future is invalid. Owner deletion does not
authorize key reuse. Append-only corrective migration
`0012_publication_replay_expiry_guard` makes PostgreSQL's `clock_timestamp()` the
sole expiry authority for the completed-to-expired transition; application time
cannot authorize early shredding. Append-only `0013_publication_operation_database_clock`
also makes PostgreSQL's transaction clock the immutable completion authority:
`created_at`, `completed_at`, and `updated_at` are the transaction timestamp and
`expires_at` is exactly 24 hours later. The repository obtains that same database
timestamp before encrypting the response, so application clock skew cannot create
an early or late replay window and the stored AAD inputs remain exact.
Append-only `0016_publication_operation_retention` bounds archive storage, and
`0017_publication_idempotency_key_retirement` caps archive purge plus live
compaction to one shared batch limit while the timestamped-key contract preserves
permanent retirement after purge.

Live response-encryption keys come only from dedicated secure files. The current
key is used for new writes; one previous key may be accepted only through an exact
UTC deadline covering every still-live response it must decrypt. Key IDs, file
identity, and key content must be pairwise distinct from token, lifecycle, access,
and reconciliation authorities. The app checks every authority it can access; a
privileged pre-candidate verifier additionally compares response keys with runtime
and migrator database credentials and the deployment HMAC without mounting those
privileged secrets into the app. For an optional previous response key, the
authenticated environment must provide the complete KID, UTC deadline, and exact
container path beneath `/run/secrets/music-publication-response/`; the verifier
maps that relative path to the configured host publication directory and rejects
missing files, traversal, or a safe decoy at another alias. Startup readiness selects at most one unexpired
representative row per active KID and proves the configured key material by
decrypting its authenticated response with the exact stored AAD context. Missing,
wrong, or corrupt material fails closed. Fixture mode alone uses the checked-in,
deterministic, fixture-only publication key.

## Consequences

- Google and confirmed-email users converge on the same post-onboarding ensure contract.
- Username, email, profile picture, and Account-name changes update mutable snapshots without changing Music ownership or content.
- No browser-supplied username, Account ID, Tunes user ID, or resource owner ID authorizes an operation.
- All fully onboarded eligible users may have a minimal Music identity even if they never open Music.
- Lifecycle, suspension, deletion tombstones, reconciliation, and retention apply to every automatically projected identity.
- Product activation metrics must distinguish identity creation from meaningful Music use such as first open, first playlist, first share/request, and return use.

### Deletion absence-proof authority

The lifecycle worker may finalize personal Music data only after an immutable-ID
read proves that both the Explorer user and selected Account are absent. Live
runtime startup therefore requires a dedicated
`STRAPI_LIFECYCLE_PROOF_TOKEN_FILE`, loaded through the secure secret-file
boundary. It must not alias the generic `STRAPI_ACCESS_TOKEN`, is never exposed
to routes or logs, and its Strapi role must allow the exact read-only absence
query while forbidding representative mutations. Production deployment remains
gated until operators mount and authorize that separate credential; missing,
inline, aliased, or unsafe authority fails startup before the worker starts.

The disposable five-service fixture is the sole exception to file-backed live
authority. It may use only the exact deterministic `fixture-read-only-token`,
whose fixture contract contains read operations only. No production credential
or generic live write authority is an accepted fallback.

### Disposable fixture authority compatibility

Raw pre-generation `.env.music.test` files are not product data and are not a
supported migration source. They are rejected without mutation or secret
reflection. Exact fixture project confirmation grants no exception. Recovery
is external to the application: preserve source changes according to operator
policy, discard the entire disposable worktree, and create a clean checkout.
No application command interprets, converts, or erases raw legacy fixture
authority.

This deliberately removes the legacy auto-upgrade path. On the supported
Windows host, a destination handle strict enough to prevent a concurrent entry
replacement also prevents the replacement commit itself; a replace-compatible
handle permits the entry race. POSIX pathname replacement has the same
validate-close-to-commit class unless a separately verified exchange protocol
is introduced. Disposable fixture compatibility does not justify that
cross-platform transaction surface.

An in-worktree cleanup manifest cannot authenticate itself across a hard exit:
the manifest and any colocated key share the same mutable authority boundary.
An ephemeral key is lost, and a public or self-derived key is forgeable. The
application therefore does not offer guarded in-place raw cleanup rather than
claiming an unsigned advisory record is an authority. Normal versioned fixture
rotation and normal supported-authority teardown remain unchanged. The
unsupported-authority check precedes full CLI argument parsing and is repeated
at both aggregate-teardown entry and the post-action cleanup boundary, so
argument errors or an action-time pointer replacement cannot reopen cleanup.
Aggregate teardown treats pointer absence or its zero tombstone as an empty
authority only after proving the complete recognized target inventory is also
zero/empty. Otherwise it requires the supported pointer, generation, and exact
three-credential graph. Exact identities and bytes remain bound and are
revalidated through credential, auxiliary, current-generation, and pointer-last
retirement. The resulting all-zero inventory is the sole idempotent retired
state. **Pre-retirement failure.** Only when the failure occurred before any
retirement or mutation and the supported authority still authenticates exactly,
the same confirmed command may be retried. **Partial or uncertain retirement.**
After any possible mutation—including a truncate/fsync/close failure after
mutation, a digest or generation mismatch, or any mixed authority state—no
in-application retry or cleanup is authorized. Preserve source work according
to operator policy, then externally discard and recreate the disposable
worktree from a clean checkout; never copy ignored fixture authority into the
replacement checkout.

## Revisit when

- Music should be created only on first use instead of after onboarding.
- Teams, venues, or workspaces must own Music content independently of a person.
- Core personal Music becomes subscription-gated.
- Data volume or lifecycle cost makes automatic projection materially harmful.
