# tunes — Overview

## Purpose

tunes is a collaborative playlist management platform that transforms music sharing across venues and social settings. Venue owners create and manage playlists while guests can request songs and interact with music in real-time via shareable URLs and QR codes.

## Full-Stack Architecture

tunes is a monolithic full-stack application. Express.js serves both the REST API and the Vite-built React frontend from a single port (5000).

In development, Vite middleware provides HMR. In production, pre-built static files are served directly by Express.
