/**
 * Ticket 2.4, package L0. The typed lifecycle observation.
 *
 * `GET /api/explorers/v1/recovery/status` returned `{status, revision}` read straight off
 * creator_accounts. That is a state name, not an answer, and the client had to guess what
 * it meant - `ReactivateConfirm` treated anything other than suspended/pending_deletion as
 * "This account cannot be recovered."
 *
 * Three different situations were collapsed into that one sentence, and the first is a real
 * defect rather than a wording problem:
 *
 *  - A recovery that SUCCEEDED but whose response was lost. The account is `active`, which
 *    is exactly what the client asked for, and it told the user their account could not be
 *    recovered. This is the case the recovery design is built around: the proof cookie is
 *    cleared only on delivered success, precisely so a client that lost its response can
 *    re-observe instead of replaying. Re-observing then reported failure.
 *  - A terminally deleted account, which can never come back, shown identically to a
 *    transient failure - so the only suggestion offered is to try Google recovery again,
 *    forever.
 *  - A lifecycle operation that failed and needs a person, which nobody can tell apart
 *    from either of the above.
 *
 * So the observation is a union over OUTCOMES, not a status string. Each outcome answers
 * "what should happen next", and every one is derived from data the account and its latest
 * lifecycle operation already carry - this introduces no new state to keep in step.
 *
 * C3 of ticket 2.4 is explicit that the observation authority already exists and a second
 * endpoint must not be invented. This is a type over the existing route's answer.

/**
 * Classify one observation. Pure, so every outcome is reachable in a unit test without a

 * Order matters and is deliberate:
 *
 *  1. A missing or unrecognised status is `unknown` before anything else. A status this
 *     contract does not know is not a status to reason about, and guessing would be worse
 *     than saying so.
 *  2. `deleted` is terminal next, ahead of any operation state. A failed operation on an
 *     account that is already gone does not make deletion reviewable; terminal is terminal.
 *  3. A failed operation is manual review. It outranks `pending` because the state is
 *     decided and wrong, and letting a client retry a transition that already failed is how
 *     one stuck account becomes a loop.
 *  4. `active` is `recovered`. This is the lost-response answer.
 *  5. Anything left - suspended or pending_deletion with a live or absent operation - is
 *     `pending`, except that a mid-transition account with NO operation at all is
 *     `orphaned_transition`: something moved the account and left no record, which a person
 *     has to look at rather than a client retry past.
