-- Canonical account ownership of the Music venue profile (ADR-007, accepted 2026-10-06).
-- A users row is a venue profile owned by exactly one creator account; it is not an
-- identity and nothing authenticates against it. A Google-only canonical account has
-- no password (password authentication is disabled outright) and no Strapi document
-- id, so the two constraints that assumed a Strapi-provisioned login are relaxed.
-- They are not relaxed into nothing: an ownership invariant replaces them, so every
-- venue row must be owned by either a legacy Strapi document id or a canonical
-- account mapping. The checks are deferred to commit, which lets one transaction
-- insert the venue row and its mapping in either order while still rejecting an
-- unowned row — the orphan a failed provisioning would otherwise leave behind.
-- This migration advances the schema chain only. It deliberately does not touch any
-- production deployment marker: those record what production is actually running and
-- move at deployment time under ticket 8.4's separate authority.
LOCK TABLE public.users IN EXCLUSIVE MODE;
LOCK TABLE public.account_music_identity IN SHARE ROW EXCLUSIVE MODE;

-- A canonical venue has no password to store and no login path that would read one.
ALTER TABLE public.users ALTER COLUMN password DROP NOT NULL;
-- Legacy-only from here. Neither is written by canonical provisioning. Both keep
-- their UNIQUE indexes, which continue to reject duplicate legacy ids, and Postgres
-- permits many NULLs in a unique index, so any number of canonically-owned venues
-- may coexist. Both are relaxed together because a canonical account has neither a
-- Strapi user nor a Strapi account document id; relaxing only the first would move
-- the same failure one column to the right.
