-- 0040: a canonically provisioned Music venue passes the identity insert guard.
--
-- ADR-007 and migration 0039 let a canonically provisioned venue carry NULL in both
-- strapi_user_document_id and strapi_account_document_id. The BEFORE INSERT guard
-- enforce_music_identity_insert() still mirrors every new venue into
-- music_identity_lifecycle_operations, whose strapi_user_document_id and
-- strapi_account_document_id are NOT NULL with length checks, so a canonical insert
-- failed with 23502 inside the trigger before it could commit. accountMusicRepository
-- could therefore not provision a Music account against a real database at all; the
-- unit tests use a fake pool, so only a real-PostgreSQL case exposed it.
--
-- A canonical owner has no representable Strapi-keyed lifecycle operation, exactly as
-- ADR-008 decision 5 already records for tombstones, so provisioning does not write
-- one and leaves lifecycle_state at its 'none' default. Every guard that does not
-- depend on a Strapi identity still runs for both kinds of venue: the numeric user id
-- advisory lock and the numeric tombstone check, which is what protects a retired
-- numeric id from reuse. The Strapi-keyed pair lock, the Strapi-keyed tombstone check
-- and the operation mirror are all vacuous or impossible for NULL inputs, so they are
-- skipped together rather than individually weakened.
--
-- A venue carrying exactly one of the two Strapi columns is neither a legacy nor a
-- canonical identity. Nothing created such a row before, and either branch would treat
-- it wrongly, so it is refused explicitly instead of being allowed to pick a branch.
