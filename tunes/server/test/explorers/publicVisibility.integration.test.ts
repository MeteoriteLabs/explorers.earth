/**
 * Ticket 7.1's named public-visibility acceptance, against real PostgreSQL.
 *
 * The ticket asks for this file by name and states the cases precisely:
 *
 *   "create 53 items with duplicate order values and assert cursor traversal returns
 *    exactly 53 unique IDs in deterministic order; change account/category visibility
 *    between pages and assert the continuation cannot disclose now-hidden rows.
 *    Revalidate a cached ETag after unpublish and assert response is denial/new safe
 *    state, never 304 carrying old private data."
 *
 *   "Same list slug on two accounts resolves to its own owner; missing/private/archived
 *    detail has the same public unavailable response."
 *
 * Books is the carrier category because it is a complete native producer using the
 * bounded-offset cursor every category shares (`publicProfileCursorStart`). These cases
 * are about the visibility gate and the cursor, not about book fields.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT here: the Music public/unlisted/revoked semantics and the
 * `public-parity.spec.ts` browser lane. The ticket makes both dependent on 6.3, which
 * has not landed.

/**
 * The ticket asks for "53 items with duplicate order values". **That cannot be seeded,
 * and the reason is the finding.**
 *
 * `collection_items` carries `UNIQUE(collection_id,display_order) DEFERRABLE INITIALLY
 * DEFERRED` (`0029_explorers_recommendations.sql:56`), so a second item at the same order
 * in one collection is rejected at COMMIT. The requirement was written against Strapi,
 * where order was a plain integer and a duplicate was an ordinary state the reader had to
 * survive. The canonical schema makes that state unreachable instead, which is strictly
 * stronger than a traversal that copes with it.
 *
 * So the hazard is discharged in two parts: the traversal case below keeps the 53 items
 * and the multi-page assertions, and a dedicated case asserts the constraint actually
 * enforces uniqueness - because "duplicates are impossible" is only a real answer while
 * something holds it true. The deferrable half matters too: a reorder has to pass through
 * an intermediate duplicate inside its transaction, so the constraint must *not* reject
 * mid-transaction, only at COMMIT.

 * the route turns into a 503 for the whole page. So an invalid note anywhere in a
 * collection takes the page down, and a fixture that used one would be testing the error
